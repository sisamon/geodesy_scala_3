I want to use this for two things main things:
- Test different approaches squants + neotype + Scalaz vs ZIO Prelude
- Share a solution for what is probably a very small need, being able to use "points" as keys on maps while maintining good ergonomy.

First commit built using squants + neotype + Scalaz it builds and runs.
That is all.
